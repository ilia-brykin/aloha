  "_PAGE_FILTER_JSON_ARGUMENTS_": "# Arguments:  \nvalue (Any): The value or JavaScript object that should be converted into a JSON string\n[replacer] (Function | Array): A function that influences the behavior of the conversion process, or an array of strings and numbers specifying properties of value that should be included in the output. If replacer is an array, all elements in this array that are not strings or numbers (neither primitive values nor wrapper objects), including symbol values, are completely ignored. If replacer is anything other than a function or an array (e.g. null or not specified), all string-based properties of the object are included in the resulting JSON string.\n[space=2] (Number | String): A string or number used for inserting spaces (including indentation, line break characters, etc.) into the output JSON string for readability purposes. If this is a number, it indicates the number of spaces or other characters to be used as indentation, limited to a maximum of 10 (i.e., any number greater than 10 is treated as if it were 10). Values less than 1 indicate that no space should be used. If this is a string, the string (or the first 10 characters of the string, if it is longer than that) is inserted before each nested object or array. If space is anything other than a string or number (can be either a primitive or a wrapper object) — e.g., null or not specified — no space is used.",
  "_PAGE_FILTER_JSON_DESCRIPTION_": "The function <strong>filterJson</strong> converts a JavaScript object or value into a formatted JSON string. It allows customization of the replacer (a function to alter the behavior of the conversion) and the indent (number of spaces or other characters for indentation)."
