If <strong>replacer</strong> is an array, all elements in this array that are not strings or numbers (neither primitive values nor wrapper objects), including symbol values, are completely ignored. If <strong>replacer</strong> is anything other than a function or an array (e.g., null or not specified), all string-based properties of the object are included in the resulting JSON string",
  "_PAGE_FILTER_JSON_ARGUMENTS_SPACE_": "A string or number used for inserting white space (including indentation, newline characters, etc.) into the output JSON string for readability purposes. If this is a number, it indicates the number of spaces or other characters to be used as indentation, limited to a maximum of 10 (i.e., any number greater than 10 is treated as though it were 10). Values less than 1 indicate that no white space should be used. If this is a string, the string (or the first 10 characters of the string if it's longer than that) is inserted before each nested object or array. If <strong>space</strong> is anything other than a string or number (can be either a primitive or a wrapper object) — e.g., null or not specified — no white space is used",

It allows customization of the <strong>replacer</strong> (function to alter the behavior of the conversion) and indentation (number of spaces or other characters for indentation)."
